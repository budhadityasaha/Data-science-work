## Project: Gesture recognition
Description: This project was all about building a deep learning model which can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will can help users control the TV without using a remote. The dataset had around 650 videos (each having 30 frames) for various gestures and their labels.
Responsibilities
•	Build a custom data generator that can yield batch data and corresponding labels after pre-processing the images (centre crop, resize, normalization).
•	Create a 3d convolutional network and train the model and make sure model able to produce good accuracy.
